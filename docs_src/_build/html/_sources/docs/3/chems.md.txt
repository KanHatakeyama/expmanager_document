# Register chemicals 
## Overview
- Here, you can register chemical reagent data such as...
    - Structures
        - Currently compatible with
            - molecules (SMILES)
            - polymers (special format)
    - Properties
    - Obtained date, company, ...

## Add new reagent
- Click "Add Chemical" button to create a new record

- Here, you can set your favorite "Tag"
    - This is very useful to extract selected records during exporting processes


## Set chemical properties
- Move to "PROPERTYCHEMS" for the addition of properties
- In order to add a new property, clock "+" button.
